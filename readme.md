This Spring-boot app is designed using these principles/features: 
* An inversion of control pattern mostly done with dependency injection. (since inversion of control is central to Spring Framework design)
* RESTful api.
* MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern.
* Reactive Redis and Reactive Couchbase to handle json documents both in repository and in database.
* Mariadb for relational database.
* rxjava3 to run as many things reactively as possible.
* email client and OAuth2 to send emails for login reset.

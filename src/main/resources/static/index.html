        <h5>Instructions: </h5>
        <p>Simply type any medical term above, and you will be told the meaning of each part of the word. <br>Use
            this to
            help you learn the common roots, prefixes and suffixes of medical terms so you won't have to <br>look up the
            definition every time someone says a medical term you haven't heard before, because <br>these affixes and
            roots often
            define the meaning of the word very well. For example type hypoglycemia.</p>
